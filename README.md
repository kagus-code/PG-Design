### **1. High-Level Architecture**
The system will consist of the following components:

#### **1.1. Core Components**
1. **Payment Gateway Service (PGS):**
   - Central service responsible for processing payments.
   - Integrates with the third-party PSP API.
   - Handles payment requests, responses, and callbacks.

2. **Subscription Management Service (SMS):**
   - Tracks client subscriptions and payment statuses.
   - Stores payment records and subscription details.
   - Provides APIs for apps to check if a client has paid.

3. **Database:**
   - Stores payment transactions, client subscription details, and logs.
   - Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for structured data.

4. **Authentication and Authorization Service:**
   - Ensures secure access to the payment gateway and subscription management APIs.
   - Uses OAuth2 or JWT for token-based authentication.

5. **Third-Party PSP API:**
   - External service for processing payments (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Adyen).

6. **Client Applications (Ten Apps):**
   - Integrate with the Payment Gateway Service and Subscription Management Service to process payments and check subscription statuses.

#### **1.2. Data Flow**
1. **Payment Flow:**
   - Client app sends a payment request to the Payment Gateway Service.
   - PGS forwards the request to the third-party PSP API.
   - PSP processes the payment and sends a response back to PGS.
   - PGS records the transaction in the database and updates the subscription status in the Subscription Management Service.

2. **Subscription Check Flow:**
   - Client app queries the Subscription Management Service to check if a client has paid.
   - SMS retrieves the subscription status from the database and returns it to the app.

3. **Callback Flow:**
   - PSP sends payment status updates (e.g., success, failure) to PGS via webhooks.
   - PGS updates the database and subscription status accordingly.

### **2. Detailed Architectural Design**

#### **2.1. Payment Gateway Service (PGS)**
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Handle payment requests from client apps.
  - Communicate with the PSP API.
  - Process PSP callbacks and update the database.
  - Log all payment transactions for auditing.

- **APIs:**
  - `POST /payments`: Initiate a payment.
  - `GET /payments/{id}`: Retrieve payment status.
  - `POST /webhook`: Handle PSP callbacks.

- **Tech Stack:**
  - Backend: Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), or Java (Spring Boot).
  - Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL.
  - Messaging: RabbitMQ or Kafka for async processing (optional).

#### **2.2. Subscription Management Service (SMS)**
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Manage client subscriptions and payment statuses.
  - Provide APIs for apps to check subscription status.
  - Handle subscription renewals and expirations.

- **APIs:**
  - `GET /subscriptions/{client_id}`: Check if a client has paid.
  - `POST /subscriptions`: Create or update a subscription.
  - `DELETE /subscriptions/{id}`: Cancel a subscription.

- **Tech Stack:**
  - Backend: Same as PGS for consistency.
  - Database: Shared with PGS or a separate database for scalability.

#### **2.3. Database Design**
- **Tables:**
  - `payments`: Stores payment transactions (id, client_id, amount, status, timestamp).
  - `subscriptions`: Stores subscription details (id, client_id, start_date, end_date, status).
  - `clients`: Stores client information (id, name, email, app_id).

- **Relationships:**
  - One client can have multiple payments.
  - One client can have one active subscription.

#### **2.4. Authentication and Authorization**
- Use OAuth2 or JWT for secure API access.
- Each client app must authenticate before accessing PGS or SMS APIs.
- Implement role-based access control (e.g., admin, app, client).

#### **2.5. Third-Party PSP Integration**
- Use the PSP's SDK or REST API for payment processing.
- Implement webhooks to handle payment status updates.
- Ensure secure communication (HTTPS, API keys, etc.).

### **3. Implementation Plan**

#### **3.1. Phase 1: Requirements Gathering and Planning**
- Identify the PSP to integrate with (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
- Define the payment flow and subscription logic.
- Design the database schema and API contracts.

#### **3.2. Phase 2: Development**
1. **Set up the Payment Gateway Service:**
   - Implement APIs for payment processing and webhooks.
   - Integrate with the PSP API.

2. **Set up the Subscription Management Service:**
   - Implement APIs for subscription management.
   - Build logic for checking subscription statuses.

3. **Set up the Database:**
   - Create tables for payments, subscriptions, and clients.
   - Define relationships and constraints.

4. **Implement Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Set up OAuth2 or JWT for secure API access.

#### **3.3. Phase 3: Integration**
- Integrate the Payment Gateway Service and Subscription Management Service with the ten apps.
- Test the payment flow and subscription checks.

#### **3.4. Phase 4: Testing**
- Perform unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
- Test edge cases (e.g., failed payments, expired subscriptions).

#### **3.5. Phase 5: Deployment**
- Deploy the services to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Set up monitoring and logging (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack).
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.

#### **3.6. Phase 6: Maintenance**
- Monitor the system for issues.
- Handle PSP API updates and changes.
- Scale the system as the number of apps and clients grows.

### **4. Scalability and Security Considerations**
- **Scalability:**
  - Use load balancers and auto-scaling for high availability.
  - Cache frequently accessed data (e.g., subscription statuses) using Redis or Memcached.
  - Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for async processing.

- **Security:**
  - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., payment details) in the database.
  - Use HTTPS for all API communication.
  - Regularly audit the system for vulnerabilities.

---

### **5. Tech Stack Recommendations**
- **Backend:** Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), or Java (Spring Boot).
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- **Caching:** Redis or Memcached.
- **Messaging:** RabbitMQ or Kafka.
- **Cloud Platform:** AWS, Azure, or GCP.
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack.
